**aws-ec2/** contains sample scripts that run on files stored on Amazon S3.
**data-for-local-installation/** contain the data provided in the local installation, 
which is used for the scripts in **scripts-for-local-installation/**

Both **aws-ec2/** and **scripts-for-local-installation/** contain sample scripts that give you a brief description of how to analyze different sets of data, in an effort to get you used to essentia and on your way analyzing your own data. 
There is also a very useful tutorial at http://www.auriq.net/processing-your-data/ that we highly recommend you go through as it provides a detailed introduction to the primary essentia commands.
